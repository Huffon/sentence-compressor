Bartholomew JoJo Simpson is a fictional character in the American animated television series The Simpsons and part of the Simpson family.
He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987.
Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip, Life in Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters.
While the rest of the characters were named after Groening's family members, Bart's name is an anagram of the word brat.
After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family received its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989.
At ten years old, Bart is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge, and the brother of Lisa and Maggie.
Bart's most prominent and popular character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness and disrespect for authority.
He has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons – including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books – and inspired an entire line of merchandise.
In casting, Nancy Cartwright originally planned to audition for the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart.
Hallmarks of the character include his chalkboard gags in the opening sequence; his prank calls to Moe; and his catchphrases "Eat my shorts", "¡Ay, caramba!", "Don't have a cow, man!", and "I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?".
During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's breakout character and "Bartmania" ensued, spawning Bart Simpson-themed merchandise touting his rebellious attitude and pride at underachieving, which caused many parents and educators to cast him as a bad role model for children.
Around the third season, the series started to focus more on the family as a whole, though Bart still remains a prominent character.
Time named Bart one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century, and he was named "entertainer of the year" in 1990 by Entertainment Weekly.
Nancy Cartwright has won several awards for voicing Bart, including a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 and an Annie Award in 1995.

Managing relationships is a value that represents how someone considers the interests and well-being of other people involved in a person's social world.
When people provide food for others, share food with others or receive food from others, they typically consider the needs, preferences and feelings of those people related to what, how, when and where food is eaten.
Personal needs and preferences are often compromised to build, maintain or repair relationships.
Food is central to family harmony, and someone who adopts the role of the 'household food manager' is typically very attentive to the preferences, dislikes and patterns of eating of others.
For example, newly married couples must negotiate ways to make joint food choices and parent-child relationships contribute to constructing family food decisions.
Being a host, guest or co-worker also shapes food choice situations where roles and relationships are primary considerations in food choice.
